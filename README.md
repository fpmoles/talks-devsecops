# DevSecOps: Building a culture of Security

## Abstract
In today's world, we move a million miles an hour to deliver code as fast as possible with as few resources as possible. We have moved into agile teams that churn over backlog to get to production. We have merged development and operations to improve efficiencies in delivery. The next major step is integrating the ever changing world of Security into the pipeline to mitigate risks while delivering at a high throughput. This talk will discuss was to improve your team's culture around security and focus on ways to make it a first class citizen for your team instead of an afterthought.
